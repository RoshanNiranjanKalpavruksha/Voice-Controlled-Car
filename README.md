Voice Controlled Car

This project builds a voice controlled car that can be controlled by voice commands and it conveniently reacts to corresponding voice command.

It uses an android mobile for voice recognition and through Bluetooth the info reaches the hardware and acts accordingly.

We would also improve the scope by including sensors for the car to stop in case of an obstacle even without the interference of voice.
